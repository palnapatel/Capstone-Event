### Blockchain

- Blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks. When we say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”)
- When a block stores new data it is added to the blockchain
- Types of Blockchain - Public, Private, Consortium
- Benefits of Blockchain:
  a. Greater Transparency
  b. Enchanced Security
  c. Improved Traceability
  d. Increased Efficiency and Speed
  e. Reduced Costs
- Blockchain allows multiple different parties to securely interact with the same universal source of truth

### Hyperledger Composer 

- Hyperledger Composer is an extensive, open development toolset and framework to make developing blockchain applications easier
- Hyperledger Composer can be used to quickly model the current business network, containing the existing assets and the transactions related to them
- Using Composer, you define the transactions which can interact with assets, participants who interact with the assets

- Hyperledger Fabric is an open source enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform, designed for use in enterprise contexts, that delivers some key differentiating capabilities over other popular distributed ledger or blockchain platforms
- It is used for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture, it allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play
- It leverages container technology to host smart contracts called “chaincode” that comprise the application logic of the system
